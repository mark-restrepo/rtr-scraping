# RTR Scraping 

A rather messy repo with scripts and utils for another side project I have, which involves scraping data on artists and geocoding their origin and birthplaces.

If by some chance you want to try and run this code, try: 

```commandline
conda create -n rtr-scraping
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
